Issue with doxygen handling tagfiles
------------------------------------

Minimal example to demonstrate an issue with doxygen handling tagfiles.

Project "foo" defines a function bar::foo:foo_func().

Project "bar" defines a function bar::bar_func().

When "bar" uses the tagfile generated by the project "foo" doxygen does not extract the symbols in "bar" anymore.

To reproduce:

* run "build_without_using_tagfiles.sh" - for both projects the generated html contains the namespaces and symbols.
* run "build_using_tagfiles.sh" - for the second project "bar" the generated html contains no namespaces and symbols.
